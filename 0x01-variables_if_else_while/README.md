<h3>Task 0</h3>
This task required the adding of C functions, comments and system libraries in form of header files using preprocessor directives to an existing C file from Holberton github repo. The added lines of code will check the conditions of the variable n which generates random numbers whenever the program is run and print statements based on the condition of the variable n.

This task required the creation of a C file which prints the English language alphabets except 'e' and 'q' followed by a newline whenever the program is run.
<h3>Task 5</h3>
This task required the creation of a C file that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line whenever the program is run.
<h3>Task 6</h3>
This task required the creation of a C file that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line whenever the program is run using a variable of type char and putchar function to print the statement.
<h3>Task 7</h3>
This task required the creation of a C file that prints the lowercase English language alphabets in reverse, followed by a new line using putchar function to print the statement.
<h3>Task 8</h3>
