This is the baby step: Hello World project!. 
<h3>Task 0</h3>
The task was about writing a shell script(0-preprocessor) that contains the command line which preprocessed a C source code(main.c) and terminated the process before compilation starts; the output of the preprocessed source code was redirected into the file named c.
<h3>Task 1</h3> 
The task involved writing a shell script (1-compiler) that contains the command line which compiled the C source code(main.c) into an object code(main.o) but terminated the process before the linking starts.
<h3>Task 2</h3>
The task involved writing a shell script(2-assembler) that contains a command line which generated the assembly code(main.s) from the preprocessed code.
<h3>Task 3</h3>
The task involved writing a shell script(3-name) that contains a command line which created a file(cisfun) for the C source code(main.c) and this case, the executable file has different name from the source code, neither is the default name for C executable files on Linux.
<h3>Task 4</h3>
The task involved writing a C program that prints <strong><em>"Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle</em></strong>, followed by a new line using the <strong>puts</strong> function.
<h3>Task 5</h3>
The task involved writing a C program that prints exactly <strong><em>with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,</em></strong> followed by a new line using the <strong>printf</strong> function.
<h3>Task 6</h3>
The task involved writing a C program that prints the sizes of various data types and modifier on the computer it was compiled and run on. This example was given as standard guide:<br>
Size of a char: 1 byte(s)<br>
Size of an int: 4 byte(s)<br>
Size of a long int: 8 byte(s)<br>
Size of a long long int: 8 byte(s)<br>
Size of a float: 4 byte(s)<br>
The executable file was named size64.
